# My NLP Projects

Welcome to my collection of projects focused on Natural Language Processing (NLP). This repository serves as a showcase for my work, experiments, and applications built to solve various problems within the field of NLP.

Each project is organized within its own directory, complete with its own files, dependencies, and documentation.

### Getting Started

To get started with any of the projects in this repository, follow these general steps.

#### Prerequisites

-   **Python 3.8+**
-   **Git**

#### General Setup

1.  **Clone the repository to your local machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone (https://github.com/TayyabRabbani/NLP.git)
    cd NLP
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project you want to run:**
    Each project has its own `requirements.txt` file. Navigate to the project's directory to set up its specific environment. For example:
    ```bash
    cd sentimentAnalysis
    ```

3.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

#### Sentiment Analysis with BPE Implementation

This project explores and implements a sentiment analysis model, with a particular focus on the Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization method. It leverages Hugging Face's libraries to process a dataset and build a model capable of classifying sentiment.

-   **Technologies:** Python, Hugging Face Transformers, Tokenizers, TensorFlow/PyTorch (inferred)
-   **Key NLP Concepts:**
    -   **Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE):** A tokenization algorithm used to create a vocabulary of sub-word units.
    -   **Sentiment Analysis:** Classifying text into categories such as positive or negative sentiment.
    -   **Tokenization:** The process of breaking down a text into smaller units (tokens).
